      "descriptionFull": "Atmospheric oxidation chemistry is central to understanding air quality and climate. Ozonolysis reactions, in which ozone initiates the oxidation of unsaturated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through addition to C=C double bonds, play a significant role in the atmosphere as a means of VOC removal and as a source of other reactive species and oxidants including Criegee intermediates (R2COO), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2) (Johnson &amp; Marston, 2008; Donahue et al., 2011). The ozonolysis mechanism, and the subsequent chemistry initiated by the species it produces, leads to complex cascades of reactions which impact air quality and climate through the removal of primary pollutants and the production of secondary pollutants, and are important in regions impacted by both biogenic and anthropogenic emissions (Percival et al., 2013; Taatjes et al., 2014; Khan et al., 2018). The Criegee intermediates produced in ozonolysis reactions have high internal energy and undergo either rapid unimolecular decomposition or collisional stabilisation with surrounding molecules to produce stabilised Criegee intermediates (SCIs) which may also undergo unimolecular decomposition or take part in bimolecular reactions with species such as water vapour, water vapour dimers, organic acids, and SO2. Although the role of Criegee intermediates in ozonolysis reactions was first suggested in 1949 (Criegee &amp; Wenner, 1949) and the potential involvement of SCIs in the atmospheric oxidation of SO2 was highlighted in 1971 (Cox &amp; Penkett, 1971a; Cox &amp; Penkett, 1971b), challenges associated with direct studies on Criegee intermediate chemistry have hindered full understanding of their atmospheric impacts. The development of photolytic laboratory sources of certain SCIs in 2012 demonstrated unexpectedly high SCI reactivity (Welz et al., 2012), and has sparked a multitude of laboratory, theoretical, and modelling investigations, including work in this laboratory (eg. Mir et al., 2020; Robinson et al., 2022; Lade et al., 2024; Lade et al., 2025), which have led to significant improvements in our understanding of the SCI atmospheric chemistry and impacts (Cox et al., 2020). However, there is a limit to the SCIs that can be produced photolytically, with photolytic sources for many atmospherically relevant SCIs yet to be reported and likely to remain a challenge. Moreover, photolytic sources of SCIs bypass the complex dynamics and collisional stabilisation that occur during atmospheric ozonolysis, the natural formation route for SCIs, and provide no details regarding yields of SCIs from ozonolysis reactions. To address this problem, we have recently developed the use of UV cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) to make real-time direct measurements of absolute concentrations of the CIs during ozonolysis reactions in an atmospheric simulation chamber. In this project you will use the CEAS technique to make direct measurements of SCI yields and reaction kinetics produced from a range of unsaturated VOCs relevant to our understanding of air quality and climate. You will also make use of the wide range of instruments coupled to the simulation chamber to support the CEAS measurements, with available techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (Glowacki et al., 2007).Your work will overcome a critical limitation - the absence of direct in situ measurements of SCIs formed by ozonolysis, the dominant atmospheric formation mechanism, under atmospheric conditions. Your work will provide a crucial link between photolytic studies of SCI chemistry and previous indirect measurements made via observations of stable products in ozonolysis-based approaches. Furthermore, your work will lay the foundation for conformer-resolved studies of SCIs in ozonolysis systems, the significance of which was first highlighted in 2013 (Taatjes et al., 2013) but has thus far only been explored in photolytic systems. There is broad potential for application of CEAS to studies of SCI yields in ozonolysis reactions, which to date have only been possible via indirect methods, and of Criegee intermediate chemistry, particularly where photolytic sources are not available. CEAS offers both specificity and sensitivity, and the potential for determination of conformer-dependent SCI yields which are currently lacking in atmospheric models but can have potentially significant impacts where SCI conformers display differences in reactivity and product yields. Direct measurements of SCI yields and kinetics will provide further constraints to the development of the complex reaction mechanisms used to model atmospheric chemistry and composition, and thus to understand and predict air quality and climate.TrainingThe student will work under the supervision of Professor Daniel Stone and Professor Paul Seakins within the Atmospheric, Planetary, and Theoretical Chemistry group in the School of Chemistry at the University of Leeds.&nbsp;You will work in well-equipped laboratories and be part of an active, thriving and well-funded atmospheric chemistry community. The Leeds group has an internationally leading reputation in atmospheric chemistry for field measurements of atmospheric composition, laboratory studies of chemical kinetics and photochemistry, and the development of numerical models and chemical mechanisms. Activities in these three areas are intimately linked and interdependent, providing significant advantages. You will be supported to attend both national and international conferences, and will receive a training that includes areas such as communication and presentation skills, project management, and data science, in addition to the technical aspects of the project. The PhD will provide a wide range of experience in optical spectroscopy, the use of lasers, vacuum systems, computer controlled data acquisition systems, and methods in numerical modelling. You will also have access to training provided by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Student profileYou should have an interest in atmospheric chemistry, air quality, climate, and global environmental problems, with a strong background in experimental physical chemistry or similar (e.g. physics, natural sciences, engineering, or environmental science).

      "descriptionFull": "Climate impacts from water-rich large-magnitude volcanic eruptionsLeeds PhD supervisors: Dr. Graham Mann, Prof. Amanda Maycock and Dr. Alex RapUK Met Office supervisors: Dr. Ben Johnson (volcanic aerosol) and Dr. James Manners (water vapour) Other advisors: Prof. Anna Hogg (Leeds, Antarctic sea-ice impacts), Dr. Chris Smith (Brussels, future climate projections),1.    Introduction  The January 2022 Hunga eruption was the most explosive volcanic event in the satellite era (Wright et al., 2022) and is providing a new paradigm for volcanic impacts on climate. The shallow underwater setting of the Hunga eruption caused its radiative forcing to have a substantial component also from emitted water vapour (Sellitto et al., 2022), with stratospheric enhancement projected to remain in the stratosphere for 5-10 years (Millan et al., 2022). The high altitude emission of the stratospheric water vapour (above 20km) is now known to have restricted to only a weak surface warming effect, much less than the solar dimming effect from the volcanic aerosol (Schoeberl et al., 2023; 2024). However, a follow-on study (Wang and Huang, 2024) has demonstrated how a future water-rich eruption emitting closer to the tropopause would cause a substantial volcanic H2O surface warming effect.Another model study (Jucker et al., 2024) finds the long-lived Hunga stratospheric water vapour causes later surface-warming effect and Wu et al. (2025) show how Hunga released 18.8Tg of SO2, the underwater setting removing 95% of the emitted sulphur, only 5% within the eruption plume reaching the stratosphere. Hunga's elevated stratospheric optical depth was the largest since 1991 Pinatubo, and the reduction to background levels represents a natural warming trend alongside the concurrent 2023 shift into El Nino. 2.    The unusual volcanic forcing from the January 2022 Hunga eruption The years after historical major volcanic eruptions such as 1991 Pinatubo and 1883 Krakatau have a substantial natural surface cooling, a 2- or 3-year solar dimming caused by long-lived volcanic sulphate aerosol in the stratosphere. In the years after such major eruptions, decadal forcing trends become dominated by natural radiative forcings, with a sudden-onset into strong surface cooling. Time-varying global volcanic aerosol datasets for historical major eruptions are a key input dataset into for example IPCC 1850-present climate model integrations.The 2022 Hunga forcing is unusual compared to Pinatubo, a much smaller increase in stratospheric water vapour occurring in the years after the June 1991 eruption. However, other historical major eruptions have entrained external water into the volcanic plume (e.g. Rowell et al., 2022) and Joshi and Jones (2009) found Krakatau’s aerosol cooling was partially offset by a substantial surface warming from emitted water vapour, with similarities to Hunga’s forcing. This PhD project will involve model experiments with the UK Earth System Model, to explore the climate influence from co-emitted water vapour in Krakatau-magnitude major eruption case studies. The PhD is approved as a CASE project, for this Oct 2026 YES-DTN round, the research to be in co-operation with Met Office scientists, within the Leeds-Met Office academic partnership. 3.    PhD aligns with new Hunga APARC activity & volcano-climate model experiments for CMIP7  The long-lived enhancement to stratospheric water vapour (Millan et al., 2022; Khaykin et al., 2022) has motivated a 2025 Hunga impacts report, aligned to the next WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (see https://www.aparc-climate.org/activities/hunga-tonga/ ). The first study to assess the longevity of the Hunga stratospheric water vapour (Jucker et al., 2024) identifies the surface warming effect would be strongest during 2025-2026, after the aerosol cooling effect has receded. Although the climate impacts are only weak, the event has highlighted the potential for stratospheric water vapour forcing within volcanic impacts on climate. The unusual water vapour volcanic forcing has also motivated new multi-model experiments within the next phase of the VolMIP volcano-climate sub-group of CMIP7 (Zanchettin et al., 2016; 2022). The World Climate Programme has a co-ordinating “Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change” lighthouse activity (Findell et al., 2023), the Leeds supervisors playing a leading role also in the APARC international activity, and the 2025 Hunga impacts report, to be released in December 2025, during AGU conference week. 4.    The PhD projectThis PhD project will involve simulations with the UK Earth System Model (Sellar et al., 2019a, 2019b), with new stratospheric water vapour volcanic forcing datasets to represent impacts from Hunga-like water-rich major eruptions.The Leeds team developed the interactive volcanic aerosol configuration of the UK composition-climate model UM-UKCA (Dhomse et al., 2020; Marshall et al., 2019; Dhomse et al., 2014) and the UKESM model experiments in the PhD will be designed to understand the progression of a scaled-up Hunga case study in preparedness for future major water-rich eruption.The UKESM experiments will stem from satellite measurements of the Hunga aerosol and water vapour increase, and explore how volcano-climate impacts contrast with those from sulphur-dominated large-magnitude explosive eruptions such as 1991 Pinatubo. The model experiments to understand these new volcano-climate impacts gives the studentship potential for ground-breaking paper presenting Hunga-like major eruption impacts within near-term decadal climate projections.  The project will be supervised by Dr Graham Mann, Prof. Amanda Maycock and Dr Alex Rap, with advice also from Prof. Anna Hogg (Antarctic sea-ice impacts) and Dr. Chris Smith (IPCC future climate projections). With the project a guaranteed CASE studentship, the PhD will include a placement at the UK Met Office, to work alongside Dr. Johnson and Dr. Manners and others in the UKESM team based in Exeter.",

The ability to understand how each DNA alteration disrupts cell behaviour, ultimately impacting disease development, would support the design of more effective therapies. Skin cutaneous melanoma is a particularly challenging tumour type for the identification of genotype to phenotype relationship. Each patient bears intricate mutation profiles due to sunlight-induced damage, which makes it complex to discern the impact of individual mutations by comparing patients’ samples: they differ in many ways, not all driving the disease. Beyond mutations, epigenetic alterations characterise melanoma development. However, it is still unclear how DNA sequence and structure shape cell behaviours and disease features. The student will combine experimental and computational approaches to shed light on the connections between DNA sequence and accessibility and molecular phenotypes in melanoma. In particular, the project will leverage novel human cell models of melanoma (Hodis*, Torlai Triglia* et al., 10.1126/science.abi8175), genome editing, and genomic tools to study (epi)genotype-to-phenotype relationships in this disease. The specifics of the projects will be tailored to the student’s interests and will be discussed during the interview.The student will be part of the Torlai Triglia lab (https://ettlab.science). We are a recently-established group within the School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences (SBBS) at QMUL. Our goal is to causally connect DNA alterations with molecular and cell phenotypes during disease development to identify actionable targets for personalised therapies, through a combination of experimental and computational tools. As part of our team, you will master interdisciplinary skills in computational and molecular/ cell biology.Research EnvironmentYou will be based at the Blizard Institute, a state-of-the-art research centre in east London (Whitechapel).

Currently we do not know why this difference exists, but explaining why are some people are vulnerable while others are susceptible is key to targeting treatments appropriately. One explanation may be that HCMV proteins that ‘turn off’ cellular immunity by binding to NK and T-cells differ between different viral strains.This PhD will develop cutting-edge organoid systems to model immunological control of infection in vitro. They will then determine the molecular details of how the different versions of these proteins bind to T-cells and NK cells and why they have different abilities to prevent immunological control. It will use single-cell technologies to investigate which signalling pathways are triggered within the immune cells by these interactions and what the impact of activating these pathways is on the long-term function and activity of NK/T-cells. As well as improving our understanding of viral control, the project will inform on the fundamental mechanisms by which human immune cells can be activated and/or inhibited in different scenarios.This PhD will offer training in in vitro cellular, virological, molecular, and immunological assays, including organoid development and single-cell technologies, investigating key molecular mechanisms that control immune system function. The supervisory team has over 20 years experience within viral immune-modulation and HCMV research, and run a successful team of PhD and post-doctoral researchers funded by the Wellcome trust and MRC amongst others. The PhD student will also be part of the ‘Wales Applied Virology Unit’ a new unit established by the Welsh Government and led by the main supervisor, which aims to promote cross-disciplinary research between Discovery science and Implementation/policy scientists, providing the applicant with a broad range of wider skills.For more details please contact Prof Richard Stanton (StantonRJ@cardiff.ac.uk).

      "descriptionFull": "The World Health Organisation estimates musculoskeletal conditions to affect nearly a quarter of the global population. It impacts health outcomes and quality of life, and is in turn compounded by underlying intersectional health inequalities and wider determinants of health. At the interdisciplinary Planetary Health Informatics Lab  at NDORMS we study how artificial intelligence (AI) and large  health datasets including socio-geo-demographic, environmental, and wider exposome data can be used to generate evidence  and technological solutions for equitable musculoskeletal and orthopaedic health. Large routinely collected observational health data, coupled robust state-of-the-art artificial intelligence approaches can fill critical evidence gaps, generate diagnostic tools, and support more informed healthcare and policy decisions, ultimately improving health outcomes for everyone. The successful candidate will have access to real world data such as electronic medical records, imaging, radiology, gait lab data, and wider data on social determinants of health (e.g. UK Biobank, CPRD) and other international databases. They will have an opportunity to use epidemiological, statistical, and artificial intelligence methods to undertake this study using multi-modality data coupled with foundation modelling generative AI approaches. Our team has studied electronic health records for over 250 ethnicity groups from >60 million individuals in the UK. We have examined international climate and health trends over the last 30 years using earth observation data. This DPhil project will bring together a variety of health datasets to generate evidence from real world data to describe, analyse and develop musculoskeletal-health prediction models for most at-risk populations. The project can involve a variety of data curation, descriptive analysis, and prediction modelling and forecasting techniques. Questions that may be of interest can include but not be limited to: 1) what are the impacts of wider determinants of health on musculoskeletal conditions and adverse health outcomes, 2) who is most at risk and how does risk vary, and 3) how can we develop early detection tools using multi-modality data sources. To achieve this, the student will have access to a range of secure data sources including but not limited to Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) Trusted Research Environment, UKBiobank, international health datasets, bespoke gait analysis data and collect own data from the world renown Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.The student will be expected to bring their own ideas to enrich the study. This is a 3 year DPhil project.Supervisors:Associate Professor Sara Khalid https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/sara-khalidDr Marta Pineda-Moncusí https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/marta-pineda Dr Danielle Newby https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/danielle-newbyProfessor Laura Coates https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/laura-coatesProfessor Dominic Furniss: https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/dominic-furniss. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIESThe PhD student will receive training, support and supervision from academic supervisors in a top world class academic environment at the Botnar Health Data Sciences and  Centre for Statistics in Medicine and the NDORMS at the University of Oxford. The student will be part of an established research group, the Planetary Health Informatics Lab with access to data, state-of-the-art high-performance computational resources and facilities, experience in the proposed research. They will join an exciting group of over >20 staff and 10 PhD and MSc students.The group will ensure hands-on training in real world data science and artificial intelligence using health and environment data. The student will work on their unique project within an experienced and collaborative supervisory team. The student would be supported to attend relevant conferences to enrich their studies and financial support will be made available for travel to conferences.Alongside with the opportunities listed above, the department offers extra training:NDORMS comprises three world-leading research institutes: the Botnar Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences, the Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology and the Kadoorie Centre. The largest European academic department in its field, NDORMS is part of the Medical Sciences Division of the University of Oxford. We run a multi-disciplinary programme of research and teaching, supported by a grant portfolio worth over £230m.The Centre for Statistics in Medicine is committed to improving the standard of health research through research and training on research and methods development, and home to the UK Equator Centre. This enables and encourages research and education to champion transparent and complete reporting of health research through reporting guidelines and training provision. A core curriculum of lectures will be taken to provide a solid foundation in a broad range of subjects including statistics, epidemiology, and big data analysis. All students will be required to attend a 2-day Statistical and Experimental Design course at NDORMS and the Real World Epidemiology: Oxford Summer School.  Students will also be required to attend regular seminars within the Department and have access to a variety of other courses run by the Medical Sciences Division Skills Training Team and the wider University, such as the UK Equator Publication School. Finally, the student(s) will be expected to regularly present data in Departmental seminars, collaborators across the University and internationally. KEYWORDS (5 WORDS MAXIMUM): Real world data, musculoskeletal health, artificial intelligence, health equity HOW TO APPLYPlease contact the relevant supervisor(s), to register your interest in the project, and, if required, the departmental Education Team (graduate.studies@ndorms.ox.ac.uk), who will be able to advise you of the essential requirements for the programme and provide further information on how to make an official application.Interested applicants should have, or expect to obtain, a first or upper second-class BSc degree or equivalent in a relevant subject and will also need to provide evidence of English language competence (where applicable).
